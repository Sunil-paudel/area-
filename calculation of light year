"""
we know 1 light year is the distance travelled by light in 1 year interval of time
so we have simple formula of speed as speed=distance travelled/time
which can be modified as distance travelled=speed *time and we have speed as speed of light as constant
and time as how many light year is inputed for finding the distance
but to make its unit same we need to change time into second and distance into term of meter.
lets convert 1 year into second
1 year=365 days= 365*24 hours=365*24*60 minutes=365*24*60*60 seconds=31536000 seconds
