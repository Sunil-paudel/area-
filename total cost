program discription :  A book store sells new books for $20.00 and oldies for $10.00. Customer can
also rent any book for $2.00 a day. A discount of 5% is given to customer
whose total cost is $50 or more. A tax rate of 10% is then applied after the
discount if any.
Write a program that the clerks at the book store can use to calculate the total
charge for a customer’s book shopping and rentals. The program should
prompt for the customer’s name, the number of each type of book to buy and
to rent and output the total cost (after discount and after tax). The program
should do the same calculations for different customers until no customer
name is entered."""
